promt:A breathtaking amazing creature with irresistibly adorable features hiding a fiercely wicked spirit. Visualized through a duality-of-light-and-dark aesthetic: demon-angel, mythiccore, pale mystic elements, glowing atmospheric backdrop, drifting falling-core vibe. Ultra-realistic and richly detailed, emotionally intense, with grand cinematic illumination. Presented in extreme high-resolution 32K UHD, in a style reminiscent of DAZ3D and DamShelma.

[Lyrics] (Verse 1) The city lights bleed through the window pane / A silent movie in the falling rain / I trace your name upon the foggy glass / A fleeting memory I know won't last (Chorus) And oh, the quiet hum of being alone / Is a frequency I've come to know / A static portrait on a dusty shelf / I'm just learning to be by myself
[Sound] Lofi, warm, intimate, spacious mix, vinyl crackle
